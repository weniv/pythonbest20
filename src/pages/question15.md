# Sell Oranges
![Ali's Orange Farm](./15-1.webp)

## Problem Description
Data analyst Ali has turned his orange farm into a citrus farm to give away oranges to the peaceful frog town. The time for the first harvest has come and the oranges are picked with joy.

The gathered oranges are kept in one box until the order date. Ripe oranges emit growth hormone that makes adjacent oranges ripe or rotten.

" How many oranges can Ali sell?

Adjacent oranges mean the top, bottom, left, and right directions, and the diagonal oranges do not affect adjacent oranges. If an adjacent orange is not ripe, it will become ripe, and if it is ripe, both oranges will rot. In this case, it takes a day in both cases.

Suppose that only ripe oranges can be sold, find the total number of oranges that can be sold in k days from the harvest day. If no oranges can be sold, print -1.

The orange box below represents the orange status. 1 means ripe oranges, 0 means unripe oranges, and -1 means rotten oranges. The order date for oranges is three days away.

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

One day later, the unripe oranges [1, 2] and [2, 1] associated with the oranges that ripened [1, 1] became ripe oranges as shown below.

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

On the second day, the ripened oranges [1, 1], [1, 2], and [2, 1] died, and the unripened oranges [1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1] turned into ripe oranges.

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | -1 | -1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | -1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The oranges [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 2], and [4, 1] that were adjacent to the ripe oranges turned into ripe oranges three days later, and the number of oranges that Ali can sell is increased to 7.

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | -1 | -1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | -1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n, m (the size of the box in width, height) ≤ 100 
- 1 ≤ k(days) ≤ 10 
- The orange box is given as a two-dimensional array. 
- The oranges in the diagonal direction do not interfere. 
- 0 means unripe oranges, 1 means ripe oranges, and -1 means rotten oranges. 
- Rotten oranges have no effect on other oranges.

## Input and Output Examples

| n, m, k | Status of the oranges | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5, 5, 3 | [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] | 7 |
| 7, 5, 4 | [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] | 2 |
| 4, 3, 2 | [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] | 5 |

## Explanation for Input and Output

n, m, k orange status output Explanations for Input and Output Two integers n and m, a number k indicating the duration of orange preservation, and a two-dimensional array indicating orange status are entered. When n * m oranges are sold after k days, the total number of oranges that can be sold is output.

For example, if [4, 3, 2] is input, the changes are as follows.

Day 0

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Day 1

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Day 2

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | -1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | -1 | 1 | 0 |

The total number of ripe oranges (1) on the second day is 5.
