# Robot-cat Maintenance Day
![[Licat's fish] Conference Room](./17_1.webp)

## Problem Description
Licat, a delegate version of [Licat's fish], a company that has become a giant, decided to create a robot, a Robot-Cat, in order to operate the company. So, Robot-Cat was born! Licat assigned a unique identification number to Robot-Cat to make it easy to manage Robot-Cat. Then, Robot-Cats flew all over Weniv World.

And on the day of Robot-Cat maintenance, most of Robot-Cats returned to the company, but there were also some Robot-Cats that couldn't return because they were too far away. For the Robot-Cats that need maintenance among those who did not attend the maintenance, an alarm should be sent.


Write a function solution that returns the identification number of the Robot-Cat that needs an alarm to be sent based on the identification numbers of the Robot-Cats that attended and those that need maintenance.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ the number of Robot-Cats that attended ≤ 1000 
- 1 ≤ the number of Robot-Cats that need maintenance ≤ 1000 
- The identification numbers of the Robot-Cats are not duplicated. 
- Sort the result in ascending order. This problem should be solved using a binary tree.

## Explanation for Input and Output

- The identification numbers for the Robot-Cats that attended, and the identification numbers for the Robot-Cats that need maintenance, are given. 
- Determine the identification number of the Robot-Cats that require an alarm. Sort in ascending order. 
- If there are no Robot-Cats that require an alarm, return an empty list.
